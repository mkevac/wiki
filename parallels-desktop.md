# Parallels Desktop

When using MacOS I use [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) to install Linux.

## Dynamic resizing when not using Gnome

I've noticed that dynamic resizing \(resolution\) does not work when using [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org/). I've figured out that dynamic resizing works through prlcc service that automatically starts on Gnome, but not on Awesome. So you just need to start it and dynamic resizing works again.
