# About this wiki

This wiki is an experiment. I've stumbled upon Nikita's [personal knowledge site](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and I liked it a lot. I wanted something similar. You are looking at it :-\)

I've decided to make it public. I am not quite sure about this decision yet, but we'll see.

This wiki is made using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) and is synced to my personal GitHub [repo](https://github.com/mkevac/wiki).
